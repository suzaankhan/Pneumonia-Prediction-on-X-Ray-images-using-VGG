# Pneumonia-Prediction-on-X-Ray-images-using-VGG
Utilizing a Pre trained model (VGG-16) on the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia dataset  using transfer learning. Adding up two dense layers with dropout and batch normalization. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 89.42% on test dataset.  

### Further improves in models architecture and hyper parameter tuning can effectively increase the accuracy of the model
